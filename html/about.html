  <h1><strong>National Science Olympiad:</strong></h1>
  <p>The Science Olympiad is an international nonprofit organization devoted to improving the quality of science education, increasing student interest in science and providing recognition for outstanding achievement in science education by both students and teachers. These goals are accomplished through classroom activities, research, training workshops and the encouragement of intramural, district, regional, state and national tournaments. The Science Olympiad tournaments are rigorous academic interscholastic competitions that consist of a series of individual and team events which students prepare for during the year. The competitions follow the format of popular board games, TV shows and athletic games. These challenging and motivational events are well balanced between the various science disciplines of biology, earth science, chemistry, physics, computers and technology. There is also a balance between events requiring knowledge of science facts, concepts, processes, skills and science applications. In addition, during the day there are open house activities which consist of science and mathematics demonstrations, activities and career counseling sessions conducted by professors and scientists at the host institution occurring concurrently with the events.</p>
  <h1><strong>New Jersey Science Olympiad:</strong></h1>
  <p>New Jersey Science Olympiad has been on the leading edge of educational innovations since 1993. These innovations include high academic standards; demonstration of skills through performance testing; learning through hands-on, minds-on activities; cooperative learning through events that require teamwork; improved self-concept through success in achieving high standards and making applications and connections to the real world.</p>
  <p>New Jersey Science Olympiad events are closely aligned with Next Generation Science Standards and include strong components for problem solving, critical thinking and use of technology. Science Olympiad also portrays the close relationship between teaching and assessment. Assessment tasks are developmentally appropriate for young children, and include recognition of students' physical skills and cognitive abilities. Nearly 2500 students from 135 elementary, middle and high schools from across the state will particpate in our program in 2016.</p>
  <p>The members of the New Jersey Science Olympiad Committee invite you and your district to participate in New Jersey Science Olympiad, the foremost academic competition in New Jersey.</p>
