  <h2 style="text-align: center;">NJ Science Olympiad Registration Procedures<br>Adopted AUgust 24, 2019</h2>
  <p>To increase the efficiency of the registration process and ensure maximum fairness to all participating teams given the limitations of our tournament capacity, the Steering Committee of the NJ Science Olympiad (“NJSO”) has adopted the following registrations procedures for the 2020 tournament season. Please CAREFULLY read the procedures below, which supersede all past registration procedures. If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:registration@njscienceolympiad.org">registration@njscienceolympiad.org</a>.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The registration period for the 2020 NJSO tournament season will open on Monday September 16, 2019 at 12:00 PM EDT and will close on Friday November 1, 2019 at 6:00 PM EDT. Registration requests outside of this window will not be accepted for any reason.</li>
    <li>The registration process has two steps: (1) online registration, and (2) guarantee of payment. Teams which fail to complete BOTH steps of the registration process, as outlined below, prior to the November 1, 2019 will not be registered for the season and will be ineligible to compete in any NJSO tournaments during the 2020 tournament season. There will be no exceptions to this policy.</li>
    <li><u>Step 1: Online Registration</u></li>
    <ul>
      <li>To register, each head coach must go the NJSO website and follow the links to the online registration form. The registration form will require the coach to acknowledge having read and understood these registration procedures as a prerequisite for submitting the registration.</li>
      <li>Registration submissions using the online form are time-stamped by the software program.</li>
      <li>The online registration form will require coaches to select their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice preferences for regional tournaments.</li>
      <li>If there are any problems with your registration information, NJSO will contact the head coach via e-mail to clarify any required information.</li>
      <li>Within a few days of completion of the online registration, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the head coach to confirm registration along with an invoice for the registration fee.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Registration is not completed until guarantee of payment is received as indicated below</strong></p>
    <li><u>Step 2: Guarantee of Payment</u></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Once the online registration form has been submitted, it is the responsibility of the team’s head coach to ensure that payment or guarantee of payment is received by NJSO by the November 1, 2019 deadline. If you cannot meet this deadline, please contact <a href="mailto:registration@njscienceolympiad.org">registration@njscienceolympiad.org</a>. All payments or guarantees of payment must be mailed to:</li>
