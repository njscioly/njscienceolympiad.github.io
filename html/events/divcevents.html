  <h1 style="text-align: center;">2020 Division C Event Descriptions</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">At New Jersey Regional Tournaments, 12-14 select events from this list will be held. The list of events for each regional will be posted to the page for your regional tournament. At the state championship, we attempt to run every event, however, facilities and volunteer limitations may result in event cancellations.</p>
